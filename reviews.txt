It is especially impressive that Days of Future Past is a success; a film this gooey and complex, with such business-minded scope, should not feel like a real movie at all.
Here's the thing about comic book heroes. Despite all the noble talk about metaphors, idealism, truth and justice, they're basically just bully-boy fantasies of limitless male aggression... The X-Men, however, have always aspired to something different.
The results are both dazzling and intimate, clever and - during one tour-de-force sequence - spectacularly funny.
I would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film.
Quicksilver ... is the coolest of this picture's new guys, zipping around so fast ... that he can taste soup, rearrange guards' limbs, and nudge bullets off their trajectories all in the time it takes to blink.
Doughily pointless... Far too much of this movie is repetitive arguments about what I think is supposed to be pacifism, and bland trailer-friendly dialogue.
This is a bloated splurge of special effects and gamey acting -- to say it's no worse than last month's Spider-Man film is to point up the lacklustre year it's been so far for blockbusters.
This isn't a bad diversion, and it'll drive all the thoughts out of your head for two hours, but ultimately all you can feel is the pressure as it tries to break your heart.
Maybe I'm getting cantankerous in my old age, but a barrage of cool special FX does not make a movie, at least not in my book, and the ongoing glut of seamless, more-real digital renderings only exacerbates the problem.
There's no zip, no driving force, no personality to these movies, other than what the overqualified actors manage to squeeze out of their individual scenes.
